## PROCESSING getting started
Processing is a programming environment and a graphics library that makes it easy to visualize your code.

Each Processing program you create is called a sketch.
Each sketch will contain two of Processing’s built­in functions: **setup()** and **draw()**.
The code we put in the **setup()** function will be run once, when you click the play button. 
Whatever we put in **draw()** will be repeated as an infinite loop until you click the stop button.
